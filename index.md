> *I didn't choose this life, this life chose me.*

I was previously apart of **TWO** eSport teams at UCSD
- Rocket League
- Valorant

However these hobbies were too time consuming so I chose to move onto different activities (such as the previously mentioned workshop hosting) as well as having a good social life while at college.
